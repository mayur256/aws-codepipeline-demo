Demo deployment with AWS services

Components involved in the generic pipeline built with AWS services
1. **CodeCommit** - AWS CodeCommit is a version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) in the cloud. For our demonstration we will be using **Github** though.
2. **CodePipeline** - AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. You can quickly model and configure the different stages of a software release process. CodePipeline automates the steps required to release your software changes continuously.
3. **CodeDeploy** - CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services. This usually works in conjunction with services like CodePipeline and repositories like Github to publish latest changes for an application.
